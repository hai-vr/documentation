  even if VRChat introduces breaking changes.
  - VRChat upper bound raised to VRChat SDK999.

## 1.1.5

- Allow installation with VRChat 3.7.x
- If there are no bugs reported with VRChat OSC config capabilities for a few months following the August 2024 update,
  this package will be updated with no code and obsoleted.
