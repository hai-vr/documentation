# Constraint Tools

## 1.0.1

### ☀️ New component: [Skinned Mesh Constraint Builder](/docs/products/constraint-tools/skinned-mesh-constraint)

A new component, [Skinned Mesh Constraint Builder](/docs/products/constraint-tools/skinned-mesh-constraint), has been added to Constraint Tools.

This component creates a parent constraint that moves with the closest polygon of a Skinned Mesh Renderer.

Use this component when you notice that attaching an object to your body is not as straightforward as parenting to a bone.
