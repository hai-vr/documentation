# Avatarlike

An avatarlike is a component that represents all the facilities needed to puppeteer an [avatar](../ugc/avatar), regardless of whether that avatar is controlled
by a person or not.

Thus, an avatarlike may be used by **People** or **NPCs**. It contains an IK solver, and physics animation components
if physics animation is enabled for that avatarlike.

It does **not** contain a character controller nor calibration data.
