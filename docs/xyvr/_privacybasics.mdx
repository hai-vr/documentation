#### Where is my data stored?

XYVR stores all data on your computer.

- **This application does not store your email and password.**
- We store a cookie file and session tokens upon login, if requested.
- We store your address book in the `%APPDATA%/XYVR/` folder.

#### What servers are called?

XYVR does not operate any server, and it does not have analytics. The only services are those of the social VR apps.

- We only perform requests to the following URLs:
  - for VRChat accounts: `https://api.vrchat.cloud/api/1` (live updates: `wss://pipeline.vrchat.cloud/`)
  - for Resonite accounts: `https://api.resonite.com/` (live updates: `https://api.resonite.com/hub`)
  - for ChilloutVR accounts: `https://api.chilloutvr.net/1`
  - Information from one account is never transmitted to the service of another account (e.g., Resonite account data is never transmitted to VRChat servers, etc.)
- We fetch thumbnails:
  - for VRChat: from any thumbnail URL provided by the VRChat API.
  - for Resonite: only from URLs which hostname is `resonite.com`, or any subdomain of `resonite.com`.
  - for ChilloutVR: from any thumbnail URL provided by the ChilloutVR API.
- There are no requests to any other server.
- There is no telemetry, no analytics, and no cloud storage.

#### What is the nature of the requests to those servers?

XYVR is only interested in building an address book and monitoring live sessions.

- This application does not modify, add, or remove any data from your VRChat, Resonite, or ChilloutVR accounts.
- The following requests are for building an address book:
  - Get all of your friends' usernames, bio, links, notes.
  - Get all notes. If someone who has a note is not a friend, then get their username, bio, links, notes.
- The following requests are for live monitoring:
  - Receive live events regarding user status changes and user sessions.
  - Get the currently active sessions. 
  - Get the session of a contact.
  - Get the world of a session and its thumbnail.
