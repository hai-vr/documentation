# XYVR

:::warning
*This page is a placeholder for a future free product called XYVR. Please check back another time.*
:::

*XYVR* is an address book application that lets you search through your VRChat, Resonite, and ChilloutVR contacts.

Once data is retrieved, it is stored offline, no Internet connection needed.
The address book remains fully functional even if access to the original account is lost for any reason.

If you have multiple accounts on different social VR platforms (or even on the same platform), you can
view your contacts as one single address book.
