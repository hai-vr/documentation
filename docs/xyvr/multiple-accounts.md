# Multi-accounts

*XYVR* fully embraces the use of multiple accounts, especially across different social VR platforms.

You should group accounts belonging to the same user.

## Grouping accounts

If one of your contacts has multiple accounts across different social VR apps, you should group them.

In the other account, click the ⋯ button and select **Merge account...**.

Then, in the main account, click the ⋯ button and select **Merge ... into this**.

Users with multiple accounts can be searched using `accounts:>1`

### Alt accounts

If a user has an alt account on the same social VR app, you can also associate it with that user, using the same procedure as above.

Users with alt accounts can be searched using `has:alt`

### Bot accounts

If a user has a bot account (such as a party invitation bot), you can mark it as a bot account and associate it with the actual user.

Bot accounts are not considered to be alt accounts; they will not show up when searching for `has:alt`
