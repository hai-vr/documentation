# User agent

XYVR currently uses the following user agent, where `{version}` is the version of XYVR
in [.NET assembly versioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/versioning) notation `X.Y.Z.W`
and `W` is equal to 0 for releases.

```text
Hai.XYVR/{version} (docs.hai-vr.dev/docs/products/xyvr/user-agent)
```

The user agent is the same for ChilloutVR, VRChat, and Resonite.

For inquiries about the client behavior, contact Ha√Ø~ through Discord: `vr_hai`.
