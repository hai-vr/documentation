Normally, using the *VRChat Creator Companion* (V<!-- -->CC) requires you to enter into the *VRChat Terms of Use* due to the *VRChat Materials License Agreement*
being presented to you during the installation process of V<!-- -->CC.

If you are trying to use products in non-VRChat applications, **consider using [ALCOM](/docs/products/listing#alcom)**,
an open-source alternative to the *VRChat Creator Companion* which does not require you to accept the *VRChat Terms of Use*
as it is a completely independent project.
