## Connecting your account

When connecting your account for the first time, it can take a long time for the list to update,
so keep the application open for a while.

You will see a lot of entries like this, as getting the links and bio of an account will take longer
than just getting your list of friends.

## Why is the number of contacts different from what I was expecting?

The number of contacts can be different for any of the following reasons:

- Your own account is included in that contact list.
- If you have merged alt accounts and bot accounts: All of those accounts count as one user.
- You had connected multiple accounts that share some contacts with each other.
- One or more of your connected accounts is set to offline mode in the **Connections** view and is not getting updates.
- When the address book is in *Contacts & Notes* mode, non-contacts who have notes are also shown.
