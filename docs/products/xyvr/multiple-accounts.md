# Multi-accounts

**XYVR** fully embraces the use of multiple accounts, especially across different social VR platforms.

You should group the accounts belonging to the same user.

## Accounts owned by other users

### Multiple accounts

If one of your contacts has multiple accounts across different social VR apps, you can group them.

Users with multiple accounts can be searched using `accounts:>1`

### Alt accounts

If a user has an alt account on the same social VR app, you can associate it with that user.

Users with alt accounts can be searched using `has:alt`

### Bot accounts

If a user has a bot account (such as a party invitation bot), you can mark it as a bot account and associate it with the actual user.

Bot accounts are not considered to be alt accounts; they will not show up when searching for `has:alt`

## Connecting from multiple accounts

Connect to multiple of your accounts at the same time in the **Connections** view.

You can add your accounts from different social VR apps, but you can also add multiple of your accounts from the same
social VR app if you have alt accounts or bot accounts.

If your accounts have different notes attached to someone else's account, we will show all of them.
