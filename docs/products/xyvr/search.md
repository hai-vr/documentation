# Search

## Search and show old names

When a user changes their username, it can be confusing to find them.

You can search for previously known usernames using `alias:` (example: `alias:aoi` can find users who used to have `aoi` in their name).

Having `alias:` in the search field will show all past known usernames in the search results.

## Show bios

By default, bios are not shown. Type `bio:` in the search field to show bios.

You can also search in bios using `bio:` (example: `bio:creator` finds bios that contain the word `creator`).

## Search in links

You can also search in links using `links:` (example: `link:misskey` finds links that contain the word `misskey`).
