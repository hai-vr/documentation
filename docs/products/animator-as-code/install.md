# Install

Animator As Code V1 can be installed using VRChat Creator Companion or ALCOM through [our listing](/docs/products/listing).

<DownloadFootnote />

## Packages

Animator As Code V1 is split into multiple packages. Install the ones that you are interested in:

- **Animator As Code** is the base package.
- **Animator As Code - VRChat** is the package you need if you want to work with VRChat avatars.
  - If you would like to use Animator As Code with *VRChat worlds*, you do not need this.
- **Animator As Code - Modular Avatar** can be optionally added if you want to integrate your work with *Modular Avatar*.

These packages are available, but not recommended:
- **Animator As Code - VRChat Destructive Workflow** can be optionally added if you want to directly write over the animator controllers assigned on a VRChat avatar.
  - It is preferrable nowadays to switch to a non-destructive workflow.
  - You still need to install *Animator As Code - VRChat* if you want to work with VRChat avatars.
