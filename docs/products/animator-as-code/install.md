# Install

:::danger
This is the work-in-progress documentation for Animator As Code **V1**, which has not yet been released. The last public version of Animator As Code is V0.
:::

Animator As Code V1 can be installed using VRChat Creator Companion.

- Use this link to **[install our listing to VCC](vcc://vpm/addRepo?url=https://hai-vr.github.io/vpm-listing/index.json)**.

## Packages

Animator As Code V1 is split into multiple packages. Install the ones that you are interested in:

- **Animator As Code** is the base package.
- **Animator As Code - VRChat** is the package you need if you want to work with VRChat avatars.
  - If you would like to use Animator As Code with *VRChat worlds*, you do not need this.
- **Animator As Code - Modular Avatar** can be optionally added if you want to integrate your work with *Modular Avatar*.
- **Animator As Code - NDMF Processor** can be optionally added if you want to integrate your work with *Non-Destructive Modular Framework*.

These packages are available, but not recommended:
- **Animator As Code - VRChat (Destructive Workflow)** can be optionally added if you want to directly write over the animator controllers assigned on a VRChat avatar.
  - It is preferrable nowadays to switch to a non-destructive workflow.
  - You still need to install *Animator As Code - VRChat* if you want to work with VRChat avatars.
