*Chillaxins* is a Unity Editor tool for the [ChilloutVR CCK](https://developers.abinteractive.net/cck/) that lets you use other non-destructive tools based on the **[Non-Destructive Modular Framework](https://github.com/bdunderscore/ndmf)**,
as long as that other tool does not have a hard dependency on the capabilities of another incompatible app or platform.

This lets you use some of my products in ChilloutVR, like **[⭐ Starmesh](/docs/products/starmesh)**, **[⭐ FaceTra Shape Creator](/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator)**,
and **[Prefabulous Universal](/docs/products/prefabulous)**.

To some extent, it *might* let you use platform-agnostic components of other tools
such as *[Modular Avatar Merge Armature](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/merge-armature)* and *[Modular Avatar Bone Proxy](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/bone-proxy)*.

## Install

:::info
**This tool is bundled with DLLs!**

Although the source code of this tool is free and open source under the MIT License, this tool does come bundled with DLLs,
because NDMF has a hard dependency on [System.Collections.Immutable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.immutable?view=net-8.0) classes,
which are not available in Unity by default.

For convenience of installation, these DLLs are bundled into Chillaxins.

If you're concerned about safety, download the required DLLs on your own from a separate source.
