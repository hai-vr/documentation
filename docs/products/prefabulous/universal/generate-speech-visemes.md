# ⛔ Generate Speech Visemes

The avatar descriptor will be modified to use those visemes.

This is compatible with avatars created using FaceTra Shape Creator.

By default, this requires the use of face tracking blendshapes that follow the Unified Blendshapes convention.

## How to use

To use this component:
- Add a "PA-H Generate Speech Visemes from Face Tracking Blendshapes" component anywhere in your avatar.
