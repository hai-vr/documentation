# Lock Locomotion Menu Item

Adds a new FX layer and creates a menu item to lock locomotion.

This prevents the avatar collider from moving when the user moves the analog stick, and also when the user physically moves in the playspace.

## Other notes

You can have multiple Lock Locomotion Menu Item components across multiple menus in your avatar, and the FX layer will only ever be created once.

## Versions

- **1.2.0**: Added.
