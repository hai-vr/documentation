# HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions

If you have an avatar that already supports face tracking, this will generate additional non-standard blendshapes for use with [HaiXT Face Tracking Extensions](./haixt-face-tracking-extensions).

When your eyes are closed, the shape of your eyes will change when you're smiling.

<source src={require('../img/smile-f.mp4').default}/>
</video>

:::warning
If you use FaceTra Shape Creator, you do not need this component as this feature already exists within FaceTra Shape Creator.

However, you will still need the [HaiXT Face Tracking Extensions](./haixt-face-tracking-extensions) component.

## How to use

To use this component:

- Add a "PA-H HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions" component anywhere in your avatar.
