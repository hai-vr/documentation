# HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions

If you have an avatar that already supports face tracking, this will generate additional non-standard blendshapes for use with [HaiXT Face Tracking Extensions](./haixt-face-tracking-extensions).

When your eyes are closed, the shape of your eyes will change when you're smiling.

## How to use

To use this component:

- Add a "PA-H HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions" component anywhere in your avatar.
- Choose which blendshapes close the eyes with a smiling shape.

You will need to add a [HaiXT Face Tracking Extensions](./haixt-face-tracking-extensions) component to create the animator layers.
