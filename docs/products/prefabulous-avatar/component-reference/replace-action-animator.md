# Replace Action Animator

:::danger
This is the work-in-progress documentation for *Prefabulous Avatar*, which has not yet been released.
:::

This component will replace the action animator of the avatar with this one.

As there is usually only one action animator, this differs from [Modular Avatar Merge Animator](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/merge-animator).
The latter will append layers to the existing action layer, which is almost never what you want.
