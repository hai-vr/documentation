# Replace Locomotion Animator

Replace the locomotion animator of the avatar with this one.

As there is usually only one locomotion animator, this differs from [Modular Avatar Merge Animator](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/merge-animator).
The latter will append layers to the existing locomotion layer, which is almost never what you want.
