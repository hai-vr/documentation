# 💬 Replace Locomotion Animator

Replace the locomotion animator of the avatar with this one.

As there is usually only one locomotion animator, this differs from [Modular Avatar Merge Animator](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/merge-animator).
The latter will append layers to the existing locomotion layer, which is almost never what you want.

:::info
This component exists so that you can drop a prefab containing this component into an avatar in order to reset it,
without having to modify the original avatar descriptor by hand.
