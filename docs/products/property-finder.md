*Property Finder* lets you view the animatable properties of an object.

:::tip
This does not require VRChat to run. It has been tested to work on Unity 2019, and should work on newer versions.

You can also open it through *Window > Haï > PropertyFinder*.

Drag and drop the object to inspect in the *Target Object* field.

Filter the results further by adding search terms. You can separate search terms with a space, so the search query `color rim` can find results such as `material._RimLitTexColor`.
