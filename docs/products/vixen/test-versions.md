# Test versions

:::danger
*Vixen* is not currently available; the documentation is being written. Please check back another time!
:::

Vixen is currently published as test versions.

These versions don't have all the features because some of them are too unstable or not ready.

- In the test version, you **cannot** define multiple branching conditions or states per control.
- In the test version, you **cannot** define item slots.
- In the test version, you **cannot** generate blendshapes.

Some features may be added later, moved into another product, or dropped entirely depending on whether it is viable.

Please check the [Discord](/docs/other/discord.md) for further development and feedback.
