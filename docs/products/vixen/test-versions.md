# Test versions

Vixen is currently published as test versions.

These versions don't have all the features because some of them are too unstable or not ready.

- In the test version, you **cannot** define multiple branching conditions or states per control.
- In the test version, you **cannot** define item slots.
- In the test version, you **cannot** generate blendshapes.
- At the moment, the test version does not have any facilities to bake assets or provide another user with only Modular Avatar components. For this reason, Vixen is not currently suitable for building projects with the aim to provide another user with avatar products (such as prefabs).

Some features may be added later, moved into another product, or dropped entirely depending on whether it is viable.

Please check the [Discord](/docs/other/discord.md) for further development and feedback.
