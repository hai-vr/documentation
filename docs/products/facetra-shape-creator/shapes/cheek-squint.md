# Cheek Squint

:::warning[**Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?**]

If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.
:::

Cheek Squint pulls part of the cheek up.

The origin of the pull (in red) can be anywhere on the cheek.

The pull destination (in blue) should be slightly above.

In addition, you can define eye blendshapes that will be applied to the top and bottom of the eye.
