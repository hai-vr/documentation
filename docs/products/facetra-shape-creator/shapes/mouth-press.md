# Mouth Press

:::warning[**Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?**]

If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.
:::

Mouth press uses a special handle, as it involves pressing the lips together.

The meshes will be squished onto the lip.

- Use the purple handles to define the radius around the lip. The purple line represents the location where the brush is at 50% of the maximum distance after which vertices will be unaffected.
- Use the blue handle to choose how much the lips will be pressed together.
