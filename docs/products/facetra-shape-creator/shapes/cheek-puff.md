# Cheek Puff/Cheek Suck

:::warning[**Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?**]

If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.
:::

Cheek puff pulls the face in only one direction.

- Move and rotate the gizmo around. The Cheek Pull position and rotation don’t need to be the same as the cheek, and they don’t need to be the same as Cheek Suck either.
- Use the purple handles to define the radius. The purple line represents the location where the brush is at 50% of the maximum distance after which vertices will be unaffected.
- Use the blue handle to choose how much the cheek will be pulled.
