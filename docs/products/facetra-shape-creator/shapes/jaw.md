# Jaw Left/Jaw Right and Jaw Forward

:::warning
**Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?**

If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.

Feel free to ask on Discord about it.
:::

These shapes allow you to move the jaw, but by default, this includes the upper side of the mouth in order to create smoother deformations on anime-style avatars.

If your avatar has a very large jaw as it is the case with the face structure of some furry avatars, you can check the “Jaw … Puller Only Lower” checkbox so that the Jaw puller will only change the lower part of the mouth divider.
