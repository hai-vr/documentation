# Tongue

:::warning[**Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?**]

If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.
:::

The tongue has several modes of operation. Choose one of them:

## Mode: Independent

*If you choose Independent mode:*

### Forward

Pull the tongue **so that it crosses the lips**. Use the purple handle to increase the radius of the pull.

You can click on the Jaw Open shape to test how the tongue will look when the mouth is open.

### Up/Down/LeftRight

Press "Reset position and rotation". This will put the gizmo at the same location as Forward.

Move and rotate the gizmo so that the tongue matches the corresponding shape.

:::note
The tongue setup is particularly finnicky and is likely to be changed during the course of the early access trials.

## Mode: Pull and Direction

:::danger
This mode is not currently available.
:::

*If you choose Pull and Direction mode:*

### Forward

Pull the tongue **so that it crosses the lips**. Use the purple handle to increase the radius of the pull.

You can click on the Jaw Open shape to test how the tongue will look when the mouth is open.

### Up/Down/LeftRight

Press "Reset position and rotation". This will put the gizmo at the same location as Forward.

The gizmo will act just like a "Pulling and twisting" shape, based on the tongue being pulled forward.
