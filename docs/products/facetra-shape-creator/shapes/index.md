## Are you familiar with making face tracking shapes?

**If you are not familiar with creating shapes yourself**, the [Unified Expressions documentation on VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes)
can be a good reference.

Feel free to ask on Discord about it.
