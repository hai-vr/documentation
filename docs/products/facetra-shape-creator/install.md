*This tool can be used without VRChat. The VRChat SDK is not required to run this tool.*

### For VRChat

This requires the use of the VRChat Creator Companion in order to automatically build the mesh before upload.

- Add **[Modular Avatar listing](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/)** by clicking on *Download (using VCC).*
- In VCC, add the **"Non-Destructive Modular Framework"** package to your project.

Open the downloaded archive and install the .unitypackage in your project.

### For Resonite or other apps

You can start a new Unity project in Unity 2022, or reuse a VRChat project in Unity 2022 or Unity 2019.

Open the downloaded archive and install the .unitypackage in your project, but during installation, uncheck the folder called *dev.hai-vr.facetra-shape-creator**.vrc***

If you want to install for Resonite or other apps, I’m interested, please ping me on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/58fWAUTYF8).
