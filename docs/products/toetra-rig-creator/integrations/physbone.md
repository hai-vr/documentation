# PhysBone

:::danger
This tool is currently not available, and this documentation is currently being written.
:::

The tool can attach a PhysBone component of your choice to your toe bones in the *Avatar integration > PhysBone tab*.

# Single root mode

If you want to use only one PhysBone for all of your toes:
- Keep the PhysBone mode on Single Root.
- Select a PhysBone component that you have created yourself.

# Big toe and other toes

If you want to have a Big toe that behaves differently than the other toes:

- Switch the PhysBone mode to Big toe And Other Toes.
- Select a PhysBone component for the Big toe.
- Select a different PhysBone component for the Other toes. Only one PhysBone will be shared by all Other toes

# One PhysBone per toe

:::danger
For performance reasons, this mode is not recommended.
:::

If you want to have different PhysBone settings for each toe:
- **Strongly consider using the other modes.** This mode is performance heavy.
- Switch the PhysBone mode to One Per Toe.
- Select a PhysBone component for each one of your toes.
