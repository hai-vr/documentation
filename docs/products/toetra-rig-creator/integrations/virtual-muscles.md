# Virtual muscles

The default angle of toe bones are determined by the relative position of the joints and tip during rigging, therefore they're different for each avatar.

In order to facilitate animation of the toe bones using a common base, the tool will expose virtual muscles through which you can control the angle of the toes
as if they were muscles, where 0 represents the neutral pose.
