*ComboGestureExpressions* is an Unity Editor tool that lets you attach face expressions to hand gestures, and make it react to other *Avatars 3.0*'s features, including *Contacts*, *PhysBones* and *OSC*.

:::caution
This tool requires VRChat, and is incompatible with other apps and platforms.
:::

It is bundled with *Visual Expressions Editor*, an animation editor that lets you create face expressions with the help of previews.

With *ComboGestureExpressions*:

- PhysBones, Contacts and OSC can be used to blend in face expressions.
- The pressure on your controller triggers can be used to animate your face.
- Attach multiple expressions on a single gesture by switching between different moods using the Expressions Menu.
- Eyes will no longer blink whenever the avatar has a face expression with eyes closed.
- Puppets and blend trees are integrated into the tool.
- Animations triggered by squeezing the controller trigger will look smooth to outside observers.
