# Paint New Bone

:::danger
This tool is currently not available, and this documentation is currently being written.
:::

The *Starmesh Op. Paint New Bone* component creates a new bone, and repaints as many meshes of your choosing to that bone.

By default, the component will unpaint the vertices from other bones based on the weight of each vertex in that selection.
