# 🌊 Non-VRChat uses
import {HaiTags} from "/src/components/HaiTags";
import {HaiTag} from "/src/components/HaiTag";

Many of my Unity tools do not require VRChat. These products are labelled <HaiTag isUniversal={true} /> on their product page.

Some of them will work right away because they are purely Unity tools, but some others have prerequisites, especially those which involve
exporting an avatar out into another application.

In order to use these products on other apps or platforms, you may need additional packages in your Unity projects:

- [Instructions for <HaiTag requiresChilloutVR={true} short={true} />  Avatars](./compatibility/chilloutvr)
- [Instructions for <HaiTag requiresResonite={true} short={true} />  Model files](./compatibility/resonite)
- [Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithWarudo={true} short={true} />  Character mods](./compatibility/warudo)
- [Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithVNyan={true} short={true} />  Avatars](./compatibility/vnyan)
- [Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithVSeeFace={true} short={true} />  Avatars](./compatibility/vseeface)
