# 🌊 Non-VRChat uses
import {HaiTags} from "/src/components/HaiTags";
import {HaiTag} from "/src/components/HaiTag";

Many of my Unity tools do not require VRChat. These products are labelled <HaiTag isUniversal={true} /> on their product page.

Some of them will work right away because they are purely Unity tools, but some others have prerequisites, especially those which involve
exporting an avatar out into another application.

In order to use these products on other apps or platforms, you may need additional packages in your Unity projects:

- [Instructions for <HaiTag requiresChilloutVR={true} short={true} />  Avatars](./compatibility/chilloutvr)
- [Instructions for <HaiTag requiresResonite={true} short={true} />  Model files](./compatibility/resonite)
- Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithWarudo={true} short={true} />  Character mods [(pending)](./compatibility/warudo)
- Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithVNyan={true} short={true} />  Avatars [(pending)](./compatibility/vnyan)
- Instructions for <HaiTag compatibleWithVSeeFace={true} short={true} />  Avatars [(pending)](./compatibility/vseeface)

:::info
Normally, using the *VRChat Creator Companion* (VCC) requires you to enter into the *VRChat Terms of Use* due to the *VRChat Materials License Agreement*
being presented to you during the installation process of VCC.

If you are trying to use products for use in non-VRChat applications, **consider using [ALCOM](/docs/products/vcc#alcom)**,
an open-source alternative to the *VRChat Creator Companion* which does not require you to accept the *VRChat Terms of Use*.
