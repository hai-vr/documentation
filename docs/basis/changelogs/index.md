# Changelogs

## 2025-05-04 (WIP)

*Authored by Haï~*

Modifications in existing HVR.Basis systems:
- Sliders for controls that use multiple choices now fade between the choices. Previously, the slider would snap settings to the nearest whole number.

Fixes:
- Fix editor was unable to switch between object groups or delete one because a key already exists.
- Fix rejoining or joining multiple servers with the same avatar was incorrectly not submitting the state of the avatar to other users.
- Workaround initialization packet was exceeding the maximum size when a large number of toggles was created.
  - The initialization packet is now chunked into groups of 10 toggles per packet.
