# Oblique Projected Surface

Oblique Projected Surface will request a camera to render an oblique projection relative to the eyes of the HMD in the Camera coordinate space.

The camera's projection matrix will be modified to an oblique projection through planes that are orthonormal to the Oblique Projected Surface transform's forward axis.
