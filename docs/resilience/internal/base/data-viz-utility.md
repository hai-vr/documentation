# DataViz (Utility)

DataViz is a utility that will display debug lines and text on the current frame being rendered.

The debug elements are spawned as tangible world components: line renderers, text, etc.
This is so that debug lines are both visible in editor and in VR, along with depth perception and clipping.

This is the main value added by this component compared to traditional debug rays that are only visible from the Scene view.
