# Mementos

:::caution
The ResilienceVR SDK is only available to testers.
:::

**Mementos** are interactive objects spawned by users. Unlike belongings, **mementos remain even after the user leaves the server**.

Some mementos can also continue to live even after all users have left the server: They will reappear if the server owner has chosen to do so.
