The documentation used for [docs.hai-vr.dev](https://docs.hai-vr.dev).

No PRs will be accepted.

##### Notes

- If links fail during build, it may be because of the header or the footer, not the contents of the page itself
- Links in index.md somehow need to reference the directory they're in
- Add CNAME in static/ folder, otherwise GitHub pages will clear the custom domain
- GitHub Pages dropdown needs to be set to GitHub pages mode, not GitHub actions (does it have to, since we set up the action?)
