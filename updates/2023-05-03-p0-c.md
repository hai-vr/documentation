# ☕ ResilienceVR IK Demo (World)

I am releasing "ResilienceVR IK Demo", a VRChat Udon port of my VR app.

ResilienceVR (RVR) is a standalone social VR app that I'm developing. It focuses on experimentation 🧪 and intimacy 💕.

This world is the result of its first experiment: interactions in social VR using IK.

With ResilienceVR, I want to inspire existing social VR users to desire and demand more from their favorite social VR platforms.

Working on my own app lets me experiment and iterate outside of the boundaries of existing platforms, and then share back to the community. ✨
