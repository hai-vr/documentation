I am releasing "Denormalized Avatar Exporter", a Unity Editor tool that lets you export avatars normally designed for use in VRChat into VTubing apps, without the disruptive pre-processing steps that would normally be needed:
- using the [VSFAvatar](https://www.vseeface.icu/#vsfavatar) format used in the **[VNyan](https://suvidriel.itch.io/vnyan)** VTubing app and the **[VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/)** VTubing app,
- and as a [Character Mod](https://docs.warudo.app/docs/modding/character-mod) for use in the **[Warudo](https://warudo.app/)** VTubing app.

You don't have to normalize your avatar bones, and you don't have to export your avatar to VRM and import that VRM back into Unity.

Normalization is done when the avatar is being exported, so that you can keep editing the original avatar model file or prefabs just like anyone
would normally do for a VRChat avatar.

It will also permit the use of some non-destructive avatar tools initially created for VRChat that are based on NDMF (Non-Destructive Modular Framework).
