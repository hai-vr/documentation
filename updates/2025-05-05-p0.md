# ✨ Activate with Skinned Offsets (Constraint Tools V1)

A new menu option named [Activate with Skinned Offsets](/docs/products/constraint-tools/activate-with-skinned-offsets) is added in
the inspector of the Parent Constraint and VRC Parent Constraint components.

Pressing this menu option will behave similarly to the *Activate* button on the Parent constraint, but **calculates different offsets**:
These offsets will make the Parent constraint behave more like weight painting/mesh skinning.

This is the same algorithm that is used by the [Skinned Mesh Constraint Builder](/docs/products/constraint-tools/skinned-mesh-constraint) component.
If you are already using this component, you do not need to use this.
