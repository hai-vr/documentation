# ✨ Transfer Blendshape (Starmesh V1.7.0)

### ✨ New component: Transfer Blendshape

The *Starmesh Op. Transfer Blendshape* component **attempts** to create a blendshape on a costume that mimics the movement
of a blendshape from another mesh.

Try using this to transfer nail deformations, chest deformations, or hip deformations (i.e. `Hip_big`) from a base mesh to a costume.

Combine it with other Selectors to limit the areas affected by the transferred deformations.

:::warning
**This component may not always produce good results.**

In addition, if you use other tools that attempt to fit a costume on an avatar it was not designed for (i.e. fitting a costume made for Manuka on a Lime base body),
it will probably not work as this operator expects the mesh data to overlap, regardless of how bones are arranged in the scene.
