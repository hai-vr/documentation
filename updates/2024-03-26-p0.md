# ☀️ Replace Textures, Convert Blendshape Conventions, Mass Blendshape Sync (Prefabulous V1.10)

Three new components have been added to Prefabulous Avatar.

### New component: [Replace Textures](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/replace-textures)

This component lets you upload multiple versions of your avatar but with different textures, without needing to duplicate the materials.

### New component: [Convert Blendshape Conventions](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/convert-blendshape-conventions)

This component lets you convert blendshapes from one naming convention to another naming convention, such as converting Unified Expressions blendshapes to ARKit blendshapes.

### New component: [Mass Blendshape Sync](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/mass-blendshape-sync)

This component will synchronize all blendshapes that two meshes share in common.

This is ideally used with renderers that have a massive quantity of blendshapes that need to be synced, such as face tracking.

### Other

- All Prefabulous components will now be removed after baking, so that uploading a baked avatar will not bake them twice.
- Blank Gesture Animator now generates one animator layer that VRChat requires, instead of zero layers.
