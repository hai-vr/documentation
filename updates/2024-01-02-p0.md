# ☀️ Assign UV Tile (Prefabulous V1.7)

### New component: [Assign UV Tile](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/assign-uv-tile)

A new component, [Assign UV Tile](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/assign-uv-tile), has been added to Prefabulous Avatar.

If you use Poiyomi Toon shader, this new component can be used in tandem
with [Poiyomi Toon "Special FX > UV Tile Discard"](https://www.poiyomi.com/special-fx/uv-tile-discard) to toggle portions of a model on and off at runtime.

### Update [Delete Polygons](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/delete-polygons)

Delete Polygons now has an option to keep the polygons that are still connected to the mesh.

On blendshapes that shrink the body, this preserves the end caps, so the blendshape still has an effect on the mesh.

This might help with some avatar models.
