# ⚙️ FaceTra Shape Creator V0.5.1

There may have been an issue preventing the tool from being usable on avatars that have a position offset
(when the avatar root is not at the origin in the FBX).

The main visible effect was that dividers would not function properly.

This patch attempts to fix that issue.
