# ✨ FaceTra Shape Creator V0.9.0 (⛔ Planned)

- When applying the same FaceTra file on multiple avatars with distinct model files that share the same base (i.e. both avatars are Manuka),
  but the head of the two models have an offset (i.e. because the character wears high heels), the FaceTra Shape Creator component can
  now specify a corrective offset that will be applied to one of the avatars, in order to re-align the head.
  - Since this is set at the component level, this does not modify the contents of the FaceTra file data.
