# ✨ Double Hip Tracker V1.2.0

This update provides no changes on the trackers themselves, only compatibility improvements.

- Update OpenVR DLL to 2.5.1. This seems to improve a weird compatibility issue where trackers are not detected, which had affected a Pico 4 user.
- Update ImGui versions, in an attempt to troubleshoot an user whose window seemed to be crashing on AMD GPU.
- Add noUi and vrcOscPort config options:
  - A custom vrcOscPort can now be set in the JSON config.
  - The program can now start without an UI in the JSON config.
  - The JSON config can be created (user_config.json in the same folder as the .exe) by toggling the Double Chest Tracker checkbox ON and OFF.

```json
{
  "useHip": true,
  "useChest": false,
  "chestSerialA": "",
  "chestSerialB": "",
  "chestPrioritize": false,
  "noUi": false,
  "vrcOscPort": -1
}
```
