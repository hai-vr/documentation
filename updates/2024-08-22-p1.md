# ⚙️ Prefabulous Universal V2.1

- Modify the behaviour of *Generate Twist Bones* on VRChat projects:
  - If VRChat 3.7.0 or above is installed in the project, we will generate a *VRC Aim Constraint* component instead of a Unity *Aim Constraint*.
- To try resolving an execution ordering issue with VRCFury, Delete Polygons, Assign UV Tile, and Replace Textures no longer run in the Optimizing phase.
