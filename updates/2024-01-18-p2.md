# ✨ Prefabulous Avatar V1.9

### Update [Assign UV Tile](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/assign-uv-tile)

Assign UV Tile can now assign the **entire mesh** to an UV Tile.

Do this by switching the mode from BlendShapes to Entire Mesh.

:::tip
"Entire Mesh" should be used alongside an avatar optimization tool that will merge existing meshes, such as [d4rkpl4y3r's d4rkAvatarOptimizer](https://github.com/d4rkc0d3r/d4rkAvatarOptimizer)
or [anatawa12's AvatarOptimizer](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer).

Prefabulous Avatar does not provide any mesh optimization components that rectifies animation paths at this time.
