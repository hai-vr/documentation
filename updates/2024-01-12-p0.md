# ✨ Vixen V1.0

This is a **significant** update.

Controls can now affect other controls using **Item slots, Flags, and Ejects**.

- They can switch other menus ON or OFF.
- They can make other controls active or inactive, without switching that menu ON or OFF.

Although the version number is now V1 instead of V0, this is not a breaking change (I don't want the major version to be zero any longer).
Existing components are the same, and you will not lose your work.
