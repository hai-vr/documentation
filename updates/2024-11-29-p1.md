# ⚙️ Starmesh V1.6.0

A new version of Starmesh has been released.

Starmesh now has code that is shared with FaceTra Shape Creator under the *MeshLib* package; this is the main reason this update has been published.

This update contains fixes in the order Selectors and Operators are processed, so that *Op. Paint New Bone* does not interfere with operators that use *Select Bones*.
