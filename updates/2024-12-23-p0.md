# ⚠️ Advance notice for VRChat Creator Companion changes

Starting from the 1st of February 2025, [my repository listing](/docs/products/listing) will no longer
officially support the *VRChat Creator Companion* package manager. Instead, it will support the ALCOM package manager.

## What happens if I continue using the *VRChat Creator Companion* to install this repository?

In many cases you *might* still be able to install the packages from the *VRChat Creator Companion*.

However, if there are any issues occuring within the *VRChat Creator Companion* during the installation process,
**then it will be considered to be an issue within the *VRChat Creator Companion* software itself**,
and workarounds will no longer be provided.

## What should I do if I still use the *VRChat Creator Companion*, and an error occurs in VCC?

If you still use the VRChat Creator Companion, and an error occurs in VCC during the installation of some packages from this repository,
you have two options:

### Option A: Install ALCOM

The first option, and the one I recommend, is to install the ALCOM package manager.

[ALCOM](https://vrc-get.anatawa12.com/alcom/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get)) is a community-created package manager. It is functionally equivalent to the *VRChat Creator Companion*,
but **contains fixes** to many bugs that had been reported in the *VRChat Creator Companion* for years.

### Option B: Report the bugs you're encountering to VRChat

Otherwise, report the bugs you've encountered in VCC directly to VRChat Inc. through either the feedback forum, or GitHub.

## What if I already use ALCOM?

There is no action to do if you already use ALCOM. Maybe check out [anatawa12's GitHub page](https://github.com/anatawa12).
