# ☀️ Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions (Prefabulous V1.5)

## V1.5

### New component: [HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/haixt-generate-blendshapes-for-face-tracking-extensions)

A new component, [HaiXT Generate Blendshapes for Face Tracking Extensions](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/haixt-generate-blendshapes-for-face-tracking-extensions), has been added to Prefabulous Avatar.

If you have an avatar that already supports face tracking, a new component in Prefabulous Avatar V1.5 can generate non-standard face tracking blendshapes.

When your eyes are closed, the shape of your eyes will change when you're smiling.

## V1.4

### Update [Recalculate Normals](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/recalculate-normals)

Recalculate Normals has an option to Erase Custom Split Normals data on some blendshapes, which might improve blendshapes that flatten the chest.

Do NOT try this option unless defects are visible.

### Update [Change Avatar Scale](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/change-avatar-scale)

Change Avatar Scale now uses the Avatar Descriptor view position as the source size:
- ChangeAvatarScale reads the Avatar Descriptor view position Y coordinate and uses it as the source size.
- This is now the default behaviour.
- Old behaviour can be restored by checking "Custom Source Size".
