### Avoid string comparisons in HVR addresses

- Reduce the number of string comparisons by using int addresses instead of string addresses.
- Addresses are mapped to int equivalents as early as possible.
- Modify AcquisitionService and all scripts that depend on it to use int addresses.
- Add HelpUrls to user-facing HVR behaviours.

### Try to fix combined face tracking were not requested

- Some of the face tracking parameters that were needed by the default face tracking templates were not requested from VRCFaceTracking.
- Update the JSON file (for older versions of VRCFaceTracking) and the OSCQuery response to match.
- Fix UnifiedExpressions-Advanced-Strict incorrectly references addresses without the v2 prefix.

### Expose functions for HVR Basis AvatarOptimizer

- Expose public functions on BlendshapeActuation and AutomaticFaceTracking for future use by HVR Basis AvatarOptimizer.
