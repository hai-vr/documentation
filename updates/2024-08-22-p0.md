# ☀️ Convert back to Unity Constraints (Prefabulous Universal V2.1) (🚫 STAGING)

### Generate Twist Bones

- Modify the behaviour of *Generate Twist Bones* on VRChat projects:
    - If VRChat 3.7.0 or above is installed in the project, we will generate a *VRC Aim Constraint* component instead of a Unity *Aim Constraint*.

### ☀️ New component: Convert back to Unity Constraints

A new component, [Convert back to Unity Constraints](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/convert-back-to-unity-constraints), has been added to Prefabulous Universal.

It converts VRC Constraint components back to native Unity Constraints, to the extent applicable.

- VRC-specific features (local axis, freeze to world) are not supported.
- The VRChat SDK assemblies and DLLs do not need to be installed in the project, as long as the types exist, so they could be mere stubs.
- If you add [Modular Avatar Convert Constraints](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/reference/convert-constraints)
  in the same avatar as [Prefabulous Convert back to Unity Constraints](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/convert-back-to-unity-constraints), your avatar will explode.
