# ☀️ Replace Textures, Convert Blendshape Conventions, Mass Blendshape Sync (Prefabulous V1.10)

Three new components have been added to Prefabulous Avatar.

### New component: [Replace Textures](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/replace-textures)

This component lets you upload multiple versions of your avatar but with different textures, without needing to duplicate the materials.

It also displays which materials use which textures, although you could also be using lilAvatarUtils for this.

### New component: [Convert Blendshape Conventions](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/convert-blendshape-conventions)

This component lets you convert blendshapes from one naming convention to another naming convention, such as converting Unified Expressions blendshapes to ARKit blendshapes.

### New component: [Mass Blendshape Sync](/docs/products/prefabulous-avatar/hai-components/mass-blendshape-sync)

This component will synchronize all blendshapes that two meshes share in common.

This is ideally used with renderers that have a massive quantity of blendshapes that need to be synced, such as face tracking.

### Other

- All Prefabulous components will now be removed after baking, so that uploading a baked avatar will not bake them twice.
- Blank Gesture Animator now generates one animator layer that VRChat requires, instead of zero layers.
- The dependency to "Animator As Code - NDMF Processor (Alpha)" has been removed.
- Don't warn when using NDMF 1.4.x
- Don't warn when using Modular Avatar 1.9.x
