# ✨ Lightbox Viewer V2.4.0

- Add Collections of lightboxes. Users may now switch from the default six lightboxes to other more specialized ones.
    - Add special lightboxes specifically for Light Volumes. This requires the Light Volumes package to be installed.
    - Expose the Spotlight Cookie lightbox that was previously hidden.
- Previously, lights inside the object being viewed were disabled. This is no longer the case by default.
- Add option to disable lights inside the object being viewed.
- Add option to support shaders that require a Depth Texture.
    - This uses [Poiyomi's DepthGet](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader/blob/master/_PoiyomiShaders/Prefabs/DepthGet.prefab) light settings, but repackaged with a different GUID to avoid installation conflicts.
- The Advanced menu is now a sidebar.
- Some settings are now saved editor-wide, instead of being reset when the Lightbox Viewer window is closed.
    - This includes *Counter Rotate, Post Processing, Vertical Displacement, Mute Lights Inside Object, Support Depth Texture*.
