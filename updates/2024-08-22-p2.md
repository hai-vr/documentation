# ☀️ Convert VRC Constraints to Unity Constraints (Prefabulous for Platform Conversions V2.0) (🚫 STAGING)

### ☀️ New component: Convert VRC Constraints to Unity Constraints

A new component, [Convert VRC Constraints to Unity Constraints](/docs/products/prefabulous/conversions/convert-vrc-constraints-to-unity-constraints), has been added to Prefabulous for Platform Conversions.

It converts VRC Constraint components back to native Unity Constraints, to the extent applicable.

- VRC-specific features (local axis, freeze to world) are not supported.
- The VRChat SDK assemblies and DLLs do not need to be installed in the project, as long as the types exist, so they could be mere stubs.
