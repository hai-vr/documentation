# ⚙️ Prefabulous Universal V2.2.0-alpha.0 / PPC V2.1.0-alpha.0 / FaceTra compatibility patch

**This update is targeted specifically at [Modular Avatar for Resonite](https://github.com/bdunderscore/modular-avatar-resonite) users.**

This updates enables all Prefabulous Universal components to execute during builds targeting the Resonite app.

If you use *Modular Avatar for Resonite*, it is very likely you already have prerelease packages enabled in ALCOM,
meaning you may update Prefabulous Universal to **V2.2.0-alpha.0** using ALCOM.

If you use *FaceTra Shape Creator*, you need to download [a patch linked here](/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator/modular-avatar-for-resonite-patch), **no log-in required**.


## Prefabulous Universal 2.2.0-alpha.0

Support [Modular Avatar for Resonite](https://github.com/bdunderscore/modular-avatar-resonite):
- Add support for cross-application build compatibility being introduced in NDMF 1.8.
- Conditionally compiled when NDMF 1.8.0-alpha.0 is installed:
  - Prefabulous Universal still needs to be compatible with VNyan (Unity 2020) and Warudo (Unity 2021), meaning we still need to support NDMF 1.4 (last known working version in Unity 2020).

## Prefabulous for Platform Conversions 2.1.0-alpha.0

- Fix ConvertVRCConstraintsToUnityConstraints should run after Modular Avatar creates constraints:
    - Run after Modular Avatar, because MA Convert Constraints and MA World Fixed Object create VRCConstraint.
    - Also, remove this component during the build to help missing script issues (e.g. better handles CVR).
    - The above changes have been contributed by **[Narazaka](https://github.com/Narazaka)** (first contribution).
- Integrate with NDMF 1.8 cross-application builds:
    - Add support for cross-application build compatibility being introduced in NDMF 1.8.
    - MA/NDMF for Resonite does not support Unity constraints at this time of writing, but as far as I am aware there is no harm done enabling this conversion plugin pass for all platforms.
    - Conditionally compiled when NDMF 1.8.0-alpha.0 is installed:
        - Prefabulous for Platform Conversions still needs to be compatible with VNyan (Unity 2020) and Warudo (Unity 2021), meaning we still need to support NDMF 1.4 (last known working version in Unity 2020).
