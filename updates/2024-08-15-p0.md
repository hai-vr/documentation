# ✨ Animation Viewer V2.1

- Add support for CTRL-K Unity Search window.
- The "Animation Viewer" search provider must be enabled in that CTRL-K search window (three dots at the top right).
- Animation clips will show up in double in that Search window, as this version does not modify the stock Project search provider.
- The prefix `anim:<your search query>` may be used in your search query to only show *Animation Viewer* results.
