# ✨ Vixen V1.3.0

### Custom bounds

You can now customize the bounds in OSC Floats, Contacts, and PhysBones.
- By default, it is always between 0.0 and 1.0
- This can be used to change the range of activation for a PhysBone angle, the range of a PhysBone squish,
  or permit using two different ranges using one proximity Contact.
- To use it, enable *Use Custom Bounds* in the control settings.

### Fixes

- Prevents the editor from hanging up when the user mistakenly pastes a page long of unrelated content in the search field.
  - The search query is now limited to 100 characters max.
- The Vixen icon will no longer show up in the Scene view.
- User-created *Modular Avatar Menu Installer* components can now be properly added directly to a Vixen Control.
- Existing *Modular Avatar Menu Installer* components can now be properly detected even if it is inactive in the hierarchy.
- *Vixen Control* should no longer cause *Modular Avatar Menu Item* to print harmless error messages when it is deleted during a build.
- Vixen used to add a *Vixen BSG* phase to NDMF. This has been removed as it was never used.
  - *Vixen BSG (BlendShapeGenerator) was what is now known as Starmesh.*
- Changed the way Vixen detects how VRChat SDK is installed.
