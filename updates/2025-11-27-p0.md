# ⚙️ Skinned Mesh Constraint V1.2.0

- Fix compatibility with VRCSDK 3.10 where `VRCConstraintBase.GetPerSourcePositionOffsets()` is no longer public.
    - Thanks to @JLChnToZ for reporting this issue ([#2](https://github.com/hai-vr/constraint-tools/issues/2)).
- Improve component startup time when hiding the component icon in the scene.
