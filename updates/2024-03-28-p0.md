# ⚙️ Prefabulous Avatar V1.10.2-beta.2

Circumvent a possible bug in VCC by removing NDMF 1.4 from vpmDependencies:
- VCC fails to update Prefabulous, with an error message.
- This might to be caused by there being a 3-package deep chain dependency, although this is not confirmed.
- To alleviate this, remove the dependency to NDMF 1.4 from vpmDependencies.
- NDMF 1.4 is still implied by the use of Modular Avatar 1.9.9 minimum.
