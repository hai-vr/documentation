# ⚙️ Prefabulous for VRChat V2.2.0-beta.1

- Now requires Animator As Code 1.2.0-beta.1 or above, in order to use the asset container provider API.
- If NDMF 1.6.0 is installed, Prefabulous for VRChat will use the new APIs in NDMF to save generated assets.
  - NDMF 1.6.0 is not explicitly required, to avoid a possible [unresolved issue with VCC](https://github.com/vrchat-community/creator-companion/issues/29).
