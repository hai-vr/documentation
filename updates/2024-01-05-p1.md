# ✨ FaceTra Shape Creator V0.4

- Change mesh calibration to support meshes that have a non-zero origin (offset).
    - Mesh calibration is now done by converting vertices to avatar space through the 0th bindpose, which is generally the hip bone.
    - ⚠️⚡ This means **if the user shifts the hip up or down**, this could cause existing FaceTra rigs to cease functioning as expected.
        - Contact me on [Discord](/docs/other/discord) if this happens to you.
    - For this reason there is now a "Override Bone Zero" option in mesh calibration to recalibrate the existing FaceTra data if necessary.
    - Existing mesh calibration options have been grayed out.

- Make vertex selection more aggressive.
    - Vertex selection will now add neighbours of vertices that have the exact same position.
    - This is intended to correct for teeth/tongue selection issues some users were having.
    - ⚠️⚡ Since the selection is more aggressive, **this might expand the existing selections**.
        - Contact me on [Discord](/docs/other/discord) if this happens to you.

- Add FTWireMeshDebugger component for support requests.
