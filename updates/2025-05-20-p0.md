# ⚙️ Lightbox Viewer V2.3.0

Add support for [Light Volumes](https://github.com/REDSIM/VRCLightVolumes) if it is installed in the project.

The lightboxes themselves do not change, so the differences are subtle.
The Pink scene is the most notable because the left hand will be lit pink and the right hand will be lit purple.
