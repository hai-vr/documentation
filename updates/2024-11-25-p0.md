# ✨ FaceTra Shape Creator V0.9.0-beta.2

A beta of FaceTra Shape Creator has been released.

There are a lot of changes, described in full in the [changelog](/docs/changelogs/facetra-shape-creator#0.9.0-beta.2).

In summary:
- The performance of the application in Edit mode has been significantly improved.
- Improvements in shapes:
  - Most shapes can now have blendshapes added to them.
  - The functionality to push and pull vertices is now optional per-shape.
  - You can now enable Tailoring and override push and pulling vertices per-shape.
  - Upper teeth can now be included in the deformation of Jaw Open, Jaw Left/Right, and Jaw Forward.
  - Tailoring can now use blendshapes from the Adaptive file.
- Improvements in the calibration process:
  - You can now define a position offset (i.e. when a model has been re-saved with high heels).
  - You can now explicitly define base blendshapes that will serve as the rest pose of the face.
  - Vertex selection UI has been improved.
  - The blendshape used in the calibration process to define Mouth, Teeth, and Tongue vertices is now separate from the blendshape used in Jaw Open.
  - Add a new construction line "Eye Visualization", used to visualize the Eye divider.
- Add new shape: Nose Sneer Left/Right.
