# ⚙️ Prefabulous Universal V2.0.3

- Compilation should no longer fail in non-VRChat projects that still have the `VRC_SDK_VRCSDK3` scripting define around.
  - Components now extend VRChat's `IEditorOnly` class only if the VRChat Avatars SDK is installed.
- Delete Polygons should now run before AAO.
