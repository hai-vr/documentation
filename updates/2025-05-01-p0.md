# ☀️ Skinned Mesh Constraint Builder (Constraint Tools V1)

A new component, [Skinned Mesh Constraint Builder](/docs/products/constraint-tools/skinned-mesh-constraint), has been introduced to a new package.

This component creates a parent constraint that moves with the closest polygon of a Skinned Mesh Renderer.

Use this component when you notice that attaching an object to your body is not as straightforward as parenting to a bone.
