This update brings Sub-State Machines, Blend Trees, support for non-VRChat projects, better integration with non-destructive workflows, integration with Modular Avatar, support for VRCAnimatorPlayAudio, and prettier support for VRCParameterDriver. The V1 API is now considered stable, and there will be no more breaking changes. ([Read more](/updates/2024/08/21/p0))\\n\\n\u2600\ufe0f Last month, I\'ve released **LetMeSee**, a new tool that lets you see your content in VR, with the Unity Editor in Edit Mode. I had initially created this tool so that I could test VR toon shaders on a non-VRChat Unity project that uses the Universal Render Pipeline, but it works just as well for more traditional projects. ([Read more](/docs/products/let-me-see))\\n\\n\u2699\ufe0f In **Prefabulous Universal**, Generate Twist Bones now creates VRC Constraints if the VRChat SDK is installed. In addition, Delete Polygons, Assign UV Tile, and Replace Textures should now run before VRCFury.\\n\\n\u2600\ufe0f It is almost guaranteed that in the next few months, some complex clothing (i.e. kimonos and yukatas) will be sold with VRC Constraints directly in them. For this reason I\'ve added a new component **Convert VRC Constraints to Unity Constraints** in order to provide options for users who wish to use avatars for other Unity applications, VTubing apps, or social VR platforms.\\n\\n\u2728 **Animation Viewer** now supports CTRL-K, the Unity Search window. ([Read more](/updates/2024/08/15/p0))\\n\\n## Patreon exclusive updates \u2b50\\n\\n\u2728 **Double Hip Tracker** is receiving an update in V1.3.0 that changes the behaviour of the double trackers. It\'s an option, default ON.\\n\\nIn short, we will measure the distance that separates the two trackers. If that distance changes too much, one of the trackers probably flew off. We will now try to detect that, in addition to the usual method. ([Read more](/docs/products/double-hip-tracker/v1.3-new-detection-method))\\n\\nAlso, when both trackers are lost, the double tracker will now freeze in place, instead of flying off.\\n\\nThere are other changes described in the [full update post](/updates/2024/08/30/p0).\\n\\n\u2728 **Vixen** is receiving a small update in V1.3.0 so that you can change the boundary values of PhysBones, Contacts, and OSC. This is especially useful to change the range of activation for a PhysBone angle, the range of a PhysBone squish, or permit using two different ranges using one proximity Contact. That, along with a few fixes. ([Read more](/updates/2024/08/30/p2))\\n\\n\u2728 In **IconGen** V1.1.0, you can now export all of your decorated icons to PNG, so that you can redistribute decorated icons to other users.

([Read more](/docs/products/h-view)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/hai-vr/h-view))\\n\\nIt also has an early implementation of that ImGui application being rendered directly into a SteamVR Overlay! ([Video](https://x.com/vr_hai/status/1829082801104166946))\\n\\nI\'ve always wanted to try controlling tools like VRCLens and VirtualLens2 as an OSC application, and also learn how to build an ImGui overlay using the OpenVR API, so I\'m happy having finally taken the time to do this.\\n\\nIf you are a C# developer, you may be able to make use of that project (it\'s under the MIT License).\\n\\n\ud83e\uddea **Project Nochat**: UdonSharp has been mainstream for so long, we may have forgotten that C# files (.cs) were never intended to be executed directly inside VRChat worlds. The ability to write C#, and have it work on VRChat worlds, is a feature that is [entirely community-driven](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/blob/master/LICENSE).\\n\\nTherefore, VRChat prefabs that use UdonSharp do not depend on any of VRChat\'s intellectual property at all.\\n\\nI\'ve taken the opportunity to try running UdonSharp prefabs in a plain Unity project with VR controls, without VRChat. It works! Zero lines of executable code from VRChat needed, as Udon is completely unnecessary. ([Video](https://x.com/vr_hai/status/1819443726319579439))\\n\\nThe fact that UdonSharp prefabs do not require VRChat to run is relevant as I want to create and enable experiences outside the limitations of the VRChat platform, so porting content could make it possible to experience content we\'re already familiar with, but with different virtual environment capabilities. I hope I\'ll be able to share more with you on this subject. ([Read more](/docs/research/nochat))\\n\\n\ud83e\uddea **Project Myrddin**: This project is very similar to Project Nochat, however, this one is an attempt to run the VRChat SDK without Udon, with the option to run ClientSim with VR controls. UdonSharp components would run as C#, without the Udon VM. This way, one may be able to use traditional IDE debugging features directly on UdonSharp content (breakpoints, instruction stepping, hot code reload without leaving Play mode, etc.).\\n\\nVR controls in-editor would let you grab world pickups with actual VR controllers and interact with them, opening the possibility of iterating faster on VR content just like a normal Unity game developer would.

Both installations will act as separate,\\nnon-conflicting installs. Projects like FaceEmo will continue to function properly.\\n\\nIn fact Animator As Code V1 has already been extensively used in my own tools (Prefabulous, ComboGestureExpressions, Vixen).\\n\\nThere is no real need to migrate between V0 and V1, if V0 already provides all the functionality you need in your project.\\n\\n[If you choose to migrate, V0 and V1 are almost identical](/docs/products/animator-as-code/migrating-v0-to-v1).\\n\\n## Features in V1 compared to V0\\n\\n### Sub-State Machines\\n\\n- Pull major contributions from [**@galister**](https://github.com/galister) which:\\n  - **Adds support for [**sub-state machines**](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/base#layer-aacfllayer)**, which is important because it enables the creation of states that evaluate multiple transitions within one frame,\\n    which is not possible to do without sub-state machines (with one exception).\\n    - This trait is already extensively used in *ComboGestureExpressions V2* and above.\\n  - Share functionality of state and sub-state machines.\\n  - Share functionality of Int and Float parameters together.\\n```csharp\\n// When using Sub-State Machines, the Sub-State Machine will evaluate all transitions until\\n// it resolves a destination state within one single frame.\\n// This means it can traverse multiple transition conditions at once, no matter how nested\\n// the Sub-State Machine is.\\n//\\n// This is not doable with just states, so Sub-State Machines have a functional value beyond mere organization.\\nvar a = layer.IntParameter(\\"IntA\\");\\nvar b = layer.IntParameter(\\"IntB\\");\\nvar rootSsm = layer.NewSubStateMachine(\\"UsingNestedSubStateMachines\\");\\nfor (var i = 0;

This is made specifically for non-destructive workflows, where additional features are built separately,\\n  and then merged by a framework (i.e. Modular Avatar Merge Animator, or VRCFury Full Controller).\\n- Animator As Code V1 has a separate package specifically to create Modular Avatar components, see the section later on this page.\\n```csharp\\n// When creating a new controller, the ContainerMode of the configuration usually needs to be\\n// set to either `Container.OnlyWhenPersistenceRequired` or `Container.Everything`.\\n//\\n// This is because it is not possible to add state behaviours to states unless the Animator Controller\\n// is already persisted in the asset database.\\nvar controller = aac.NewAnimatorController();\\nvar fx = controller.NewLayer();\\n```\\n\\n## VRChat-specific features\\n\\n### AnimatorPlayAudio\\n\\n- *Animator As Code for VRChat* adds support for **VRCAnimatorPlayAudio** through the `AacFlState.Audio(AudioSource or string, ...)` function,\\n  [which takes a lambda expression as a parameter](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/vrchat#audio-editing-aacvrcfleditanimatorplayaudio).\\n\\n```csharp\\nAudioSource source = MyAudioSource(); // This can be a string instead.\\nAudioClip[] clips = MyAudioClips();\\nlayer.NewState(\\"UsingAudio\\")\\n    .Audio(source, audio =>\\n    {\\n        // Get the PlayAudio object if there\'s a need to edit it directly.\\n        VRCAnimatorPlayAudio vrcAnimatorPlayAudio = audio.PlayAudio;\\n\\n        // By default, a PlayAudio created through AAC does nothing (unlike a manually created behaviour)\\n        // so you need to invoke anything that is relevant.\\n        audio\\n            .SelectsClip(VRC_AnimatorPlayAudio.Order.Random, clips)\\n            .SetsLooping()\\n            .RandomizesPitch(0.8f, 1.2f)\\n            .RandomizesVolume(0.5f, 1f)\\n            // \\"Replays\\" means Stop and Play.\\n            // \\"StartsPlaying\\" means just Play.\\n            // \\"StopsPlaying\\" means just Stop.\\n            // To do neither Stop nor Play, don\'t invoke anything.\\n            .StartsPlayingOnEnter()\\n            .StopsPlayingOnExit();\\n    });\\n```\\n\\n### Prettier Parameter Drivers\\n\\n- As **VRCAvatarParameterDriver** has evolved over the years, there is now a **dedicated** `AacFlState.Driving(...)` function, [which takes a lambda expression as a parameter](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/vrchat#driver-editing-aacvrcfleditavatarparameterdriver).\\n- If you invoke `AacFlState.Driving(...)` multiple times, it will create multiple **VRCAvatarParameterDriver** behaviours on the same state. One may be local, the other not.\\n\\n```csharp\\nlayer.NewState(\\"UsingDrivers\\").Driving(driver => driver\\n    .Copies(layer.FloatParameter(\\"CopySource\\"), layer.FloatParameter(\\"CopyDestination\\"))\\n    .Sets(layer.FloatParameter(\\"Set\\"), 2.3f)\\n    .Increases(layer.FloatParameter(\\"IncreaseBy2\\"), 2f)\\n    .Decreases(layer.FloatParameter(\\"DecreaseBy3\\"), 3f)\\n    .Randomizes(layer.FloatParameter(\\"Randomizes\\"), 0f, 100f)\\n    .Randomizes(layer.BoolParameter(\\"RandomizesBool\\"), 0.25f) // 25% chance of being true.\\n    .Remaps(layer.FloatParameter(\\"RemapsSource\\"), 0f, 2f, layer.FloatParameter(\\"RemapsDestination\\"), 2f, 4f)\\n// This creates a second VRCAvatarParameterDriver in the same state.\\n).Driving(driver => driver\\n    .Sets(layer.FloatParameter(\\"SecondDriver\\"), 100f)\\n    .Locally() // Only this second VRCAvatarParameterDriver is local.\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Integration with Modular Avatar (MaAc)\\n\\nUsing the *Animator As Code V1 - Modular Avatar functions*, it can [create Modular Avatar components](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/modular-avatar).\\n- Newly created Animator Controllers can be assigned into a new Modular Avatar Merge Animator.\\n- Synced Bool parameters (1 bit) can be created using the same Float parameters objects used in Animator As Code,\\n  through Modular Avatar Parameters.\\n\\n```csharp\\nvar ctrl = aac.NewAnimatorController();\\nvar fx = ctrl.NewLayer();\\n\\nvar toggleFloatParameter = fx.FloatParameter(\\"MyToggle\\");\\n\\nfx.NewState(\\"BlendTree\\")\\n    .WithAnimation(aac.NewBlendTree().Simple1D(toggleFloatParameter)\\n        .WithAnimation(aac.NewClip().Toggling(myObject, false), 0)\\n        .WithAnimation(aac.NewClip().Toggling(myObject, true), 1)\\n    )\\n    .WithWriteDefaultsSetTo(true);\\n\\n// Create a new object in the scene. We will add Modular Avatar components inside it.\\nvar modularAvatar = MaAc.Create(holder);\\n\\n// By creating a Modular Avatar Merge Animator component,\\n// our animator controller will be added to the avatar\'s FX layer.\\nmodularAvatar.NewMergeAnimator(ctrl, VRCAvatarDescriptor.AnimLayerType.FX);\\n\\n// We use a float in the animator blend tree, but we declare it as a bool\\n// so that it takes 1 bit in the expression parameters.\\n// By default, it is saved and synced.\\nmodularAvatar.NewBoolToFloatParameter(toggleFloatParameter).WithDefaultValue(true);\\n```\\n\\n## Examples updated with NDMF integration\\n\\nThe documentation includes an example on how to integrate with Non-Destructive Modular Framework using a plugin.\\n\\n## Changes in V1.1.0 compared to V1.0.99xx\\n\\nAnimator As Code V1.1.0 contains breaking changes compared to Animator As Code (Alpha) V1.0.99xx.\\n\\nThis list does not contain the breaking changes between V0 and V1, please see the [migration guide](/docs/products/animator-as-code/migrating-v0-to-v1) for this.\\n\\nCompared to 1.0.99xx:\\n- Commit breaking changes to fix inconsistencies in the API:\\n  - \u26a1 (BREAKING) AacFlController.AnimatorController is no longer settable.\\n  - \u26a1 (BREAKING) Replace public readonly fields with get-only properties.\\n  - \u26a1 (BREAKING) Rename AacFlSettingObjectReferenceKeyframes to AacFlSettingKeyframesObjectReference.\\n  - \u26a1 (BREAKING) Make constructors non-public.\\n    - WARNING: The AacFlSettingKeyframes constructor will be made private/internal in V1.2.0.\\n    - For compatibility reasons it remains public for the duration of V1.1.x.\\n- Fix inconsistencies in the API:\\n  - Rename AacFlState.WithMotionTime to AacFlState.MotionTime.\\n  - Rename *Percent to *Normalized.\\n  - Add additional single-valued and array overloads.\\n  - Make Component[] methods null-element safe.\\n  - Add AacFlSettingCurveObjectReference.WithUnit to be on-par with AacFlSettingCurve.\\n  - Add AacFlSettingCurveColor.WithUnit to be on-par with AacFlSettingCurve.\\n- Inline documentation pass.\\n- Update LICENSE: Add galister for major contributions.\\n- Accomodate new VRCAnimatorPlayAudio requirements:\\n  - Nodes need to know the Animator Root, so that relative paths can be resolved during the creation of State behaviours (i.e. Relative path of an AudioSource).\\n  - Nodes need to have the ability to create a New Behaviour, even if one already exists.\\n- Functional fixes:\\n  - Fix AacFlState.WithCycleOffset(AacFlFloatParameter floatParam) now correctly enables the parameter.\\n  - Fix Any state transitions will be created from SSMs:\\n    - Due to an implementation error, creating Any state transitions previously did not have any effect in the graph.\\n    - This now creates Any state from the root machine.\\n    - Sub-state machines \\"cannot\\" have Any state transitions created directly from them.\\n    - Internally, Any always comes from the root state machine, but visually in the graph, it will come from the sub-state machine.\\n  - Make sure State and SSM names don\'t contain a period \'.\':\\n    - If the name of a state contains a period \\".\\", it can cause the animator to misbehave, so sanitize it.\\n    - Transitions would not work properly during the runtime execution of the animator.\\n    - Apparently this is because sub state machines internally use the dot as a separator.\\n    - Sanitize the name so that menu state names such as \\"J. Inner\\" don\'t mess things up.\\n  - Fix calling Or() after TransitionsFromEntry().When(...) no longer fails:\\n    - Calling Or() after TransitionsFromEntry().When(...) used to fail due to an unexpected internal state.\\n    - This was due to the implicit conversion operator, which converted a null AnimationState to a AacTransitionEndpoint containing null in it.\\n    - Fix this by returning null in the implicit conversion operators.\\n- Add AacAccessorForExtensions:\\n  - Add static class AacAccessorForExtensions:\\n    - Provides methods for use by extension functions, exposing methods departing from normal fluent interface usage.\\n  - Prepare to make methods marked \\"Not for public use\\" private starting from V1.2.0.\\n  - Due to their active use in other packages, it is not immediately private.\\n\\nOther notes:\\n- Generated assets will now be created with the following prefix: \\"zAutogenerated/\\", which may group the animations together in some editor views.\\n  - This change is a derivative of a suggestion by [nullstalgia](https://github.com/nullstalgia) in the CGE repository.\\n\\n## Future breaking changes in V1.2.0\\n\\n- The AacFlSettingKeyframes constructor will be made private/internal in V1.2.0.\\n  - For compatibility reasons it remains public for the duration of V1.1.x.\\n  - It is already marked as obsolete in V1.1.x.\\n- The methods AacFlBase.InternalConfiguration and AacFlBase.InternalDoCreateLayer will be made private/internal in V1.2.0.\\n  -

released *Animator As Code* version 0 (V0).\\n\\nDuring 2023, I had started to move towards *Animator As Code* to version 1 (V1), in order to do the following breaking changes:\\n- Pull major contributions from [**@galister**](https://github.com/galister) which:\\n  - **Adds support for sub-state machines**, which is important because it enables the creation of states that evaluate multiple transitions within one frame,\\nwhich is not possible to do without sub-state machines (with one exception).\\n    - This trait is already extensively used in *ComboGestureExpressions V2* and above.\\n  - Share functionality of state and sub-state machines.\\n  - Share functionality of Int and Float parameters together.\\n- Make it usable in **non-VRChat** avatar projects. \\n  - VRChat-related functionality is now exposed as extension functions in a separate package.\\n  - Also, separate destructive functions and non-destructive functions.\\n  - Since this no longer requires a VRChat project, this also means it may now be usable in VRChat world projects.\\n- Make it more usable in non-destructive components.\\n  - It is already in use in *Prefabulous* and *Vixen*.\\n- Move to packages, for distribution using VCC (and now, ALCOM).\\n\\nMy own projects, such as *ComboGestureExpressions* V3, *Vixen*, and *Prefabulous for VRChat*, already use *Animator As Code* V1.\\n\\nThe project has stalled for long enough, I think it\'s finally time to give it the last push for release.\\n\\n## V0 and V1 can be installed in the same project\\n\\nOne of the goals of *Animator As Code* V1 is to **preserve the ability for V0 and V1 to be installed in the same project**,\\nas *Animator As Code* V0 is currently being used in the wild.\\n\\nTherefore, installing *Animator As Code* V1 will not interfere with *Animator As Code* V0.\\n\\nEven then, *Animator As Code* V0 and V1 are almost identical in syntax, so [migrating from V0 and V1 should not be a challenge](/docs/products/animator-as-code/migrating-v0-to-v1).\\n\\n## There may be some breaking changes during the beta\\n\\n*Animator As Code V1* will be entering a beta phase before release, which should ideally last a month.\\n\\nBeta versions of *Animator As Code* V1 will only be available as **pre-release packages**, and they may contain breaking changes between two beta versions.\\n\\nThe objective of the Beta is to capture the last inconsistencies in the API, including naming conventions, method signatures, exposed functions and classes,\\npublic fields vs public properties, etc. It will also be to complete the documentation, both on this site, and inline documentation.\\n\\nAfter *Animator As Code* V1 comes out of beta in 1.1.0, there should not be any more breaking changes.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- As mentioned before, you can create [**sub-state machines**](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/base#layer-aacfllayer).\\n- It is now possible to build Unity [**BlendTree** assets using a fluent interface](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/base#blend-trees-aacflblendtree).\\n- *Animator As Code for VRChat* supports for **VRCAnimatorPlayAudio** through the `AacFlState.Audio(AudioSource or string, ...)` function,\\n  [which takes a lambda expression as a parameter](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/vrchat#audio-editing-aacvrcfleditanimatorplayaudio).\\n- As *VRCAvatarParameterDriver* has evolved over the years, you can now build multiple **VRCAvatarParameterDriver** behaviours on the same state\\n  through the `AacFlState.Driving(...)` function, [which takes a lambda expression as a parameter](/docs/products/animator-as-code/functions/vrchat#driver-editing-aacvrcfleditavatarparameterdriver)."},{"id":"/2024/06/30/p0","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2024/06/30/p0","source":"@site/updates/2024-06-30-p0.md","title":"\u2699\ufe0f

and I am introducing a new package:\\n- **[Prefabulous Universal](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal)** contains platform-agnostic components.\\n- **[Prefabulous for VRChat](/docs/products/prefabulous/vrchat)** contains components that are specific to VRChat.\\n- **[Prefabulous for VRM and VTubing](/docs/products/prefabulous/vrm)** is a **new package** that

Selection](/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator/construction-lines#optional-blush-modifier-selection)\\n\\nMany avatars have blendshapes hidden inside the head to make the character blush.\\n\\nHowever, when you squint, or when you puff your cheeks, these blush blendshapes will visibly clip through your face expressions.\\n\\nTo address this, Blush Modifier Selection is a new construction line, which can only be selected using blendshapes (it is not a traditional vertex selection).\\nIt can be left empty.\\n\\nWhen blendshapes are added to the Blush Modifier Selection, the blendshape will be simulated to be active, so that they will be moved by the following shapes:\\n- Cheek Squint\\n- Cheek Puff\\n\\nUnfortunately, this will not work with all avatar bases. The density of the blush mesh needs to be similar (or half as similar) to the face mesh itself. If it\'s a gigantic polygon, it will not work so well.\\n\\n<HaiVideo src=\\"/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator/img/blush-facetra-f.mp4\\"></HaiVideo>\\n\\n\\n## Convert from Unified Expressions to ARKit\\n\\nFunctionality almost identical to [Prefabulous Convert Blendshape Conventions](/docs/products/prefabulous/universal/convert-blendshape-conventions) has been added natively to FaceTra Shape Creator, in the Output section.\\nThis only affects blendshapes that FaceTra creates, and will not affect any other non-face tracking related blendshapes.\\n- Contrary to Prefabulous, the VRChat SDK is not required.\\n- This allows you to export blendshapes using the ARKit naming convention. It will still be a bit messy as FaceTra creates many more blendshapes than ARKit needs, such as left/right variants for blendshapes that do not have left/right variants in ARKit.\\n  - The blendshapes will only be converted when entering Play mode, or baking the avatar using NDMF, or preparing a Resonite bake using FaceTra.

For example, when the width of the mouth differs greatly between the two avatar bases, the deformations will be scaled accordingly.\\n- When using Tailoring, you only need to specify the Construction Lines of your new avatar base, and the blendshapes of your new avatar base.\\n- This feature is experimental.\\n\\n\ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f [Open documentation](/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator/tailoring)\\n\\n<HaiVideo src=\\"/docs/products/facetra-shape-creator/img/tailoring/T5A5uJCB8L.mp4\\"></HaiVideo>\\n\\n## Fix: Add workaround for small meshes\\n\\n- Some meshes exported from Blender have an incorrect scale of 0.01 or similar.\\n- This triggers an internal conflict with Unity.\\n- Due to the nature of purchased avatars and reimporting models with different scale or coordinate system, it is preferable not ask the user to fix the export themselves.\\n- To fix this, if the Workaround for small meshes is enabled in Data Calibration, then:\\n  - We create a blendshape with a maximum weight of 10000 instead of the usual 100 (a hundred times larger).\\n  - The components (vertex, normal, tangent) are a hundred times larger.\\n  - This hundred times factor prevent the vertices from being discarded.\\n  - Since the controlling animators only animate blendshapes to the value of 100 (and even then, in the case of VRChat, it clamps to 100), the blendshapes are effectively at the expected weight at 100.\\n\\n## Other fixes\\n- Unassigning the Face Mesh is now done by pressing a \\"\xd7\\" button, so that the face tracking mesh is safely removed from the mesh.\\n- The user is warned if the model was imported with no normals or tangents, as this is not supported.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd0d [View changelog](/docs/changelogs/facetra-shape-creator#070-2024-03-29-0903)"},{"id":"/2024/03/28/p4","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p4","source":"@site/updates/2024-03-28-p4.md","title":"\u2699\ufe0f Prefabulous Avatar V1.10.2","description":"This is a technical update for Prefabulous Avatar:","date":"2024-03-28T12:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"date":"2024-03-28T12:00"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u2728 FaceTra Shape Creator V0.7","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/29/p0"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u2728 Lightbox Viewer V2.1.0","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p3"}},"content":"This is a technical update for Prefabulous Avatar:\\n- This version now requires Modular Avatar V1.9.9 minimum.\\n- Modular Avatar V1.9.9 requires NDMF V1.4.0 minimum.\\n- Integrate [Import Expression Parameters](/docs/products/prefabulous/vrchat/import-expression-parameters) with Modular Avatar Information.\\n  - The number of synced bits used by Import Parameters is now shown in the Modular Avatar Information panel.\\n\\n![2024-03-27-p1-Unity_yH0bzcLRVK.png](img%2F2024-03-27-p1-Unity_yH0bzcLRVK.png)"},{"id":"/2024/03/28/p3","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p3","source":"@site/updates/2024-03-28-p3.md","title":"\u2728 Lightbox Viewer V2.1.0","description":"Re-bake lighting of Lightbox scene in Unity 2022:","date":"2024-03-28T11:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"date":"2024-03-28T11:00"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u2699\ufe0f Prefabulous Avatar V1.10.2","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p4"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u2728 Double Hip Tracker V1.2.0","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p2"}},"content":"Re-bake lighting of Lightbox scene in Unity 2022:\\n- The current lightmap seems to misbehave in Unity 2022, especially the White box.\\n- Lighting has been re-baked in Unity 2022.\\n- The package is now classified as being a Unity 2022.3 package."},{"id":"/2024/03/28/p2","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p2","source":"@site/updates/2024-03-28-p2.md","title":"\u2728 Double Hip Tracker V1.2.0","description":"This update provides no changes on the trackers themselves, only compatibility improvements.","date":"2024-03-28T10:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"date":"2024-03-28T10:00"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"\u2728 Lightbox Viewer V2.1.0","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p3"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u2728 Vixen V1.1.0","permalink":"/updates/2024/03/28/p1"}},"content":"This update provides no changes on the trackers themselves, only compatibility improvements.\\n\\n- Update OpenVR DLL to 2.5.1.
